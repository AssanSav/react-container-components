# React Container Components

## Objectives

1. Explain the difference between container components and dumb components
2. Describe how container components help us move state management to the "edge"
   of the application

## Overview

Not all smart components are bad. Container components provide a nice way to
abstract our application's data-fetching and state-management concerns so that
_most_ of our components can be pretty "dumb."

Introduce students here to container component patterns with a view towards the
Redux way of doing things (since that's what we'll emphasize in the next
course).
